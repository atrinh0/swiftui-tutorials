# Meme Creator

Fetch structured data from a server asynchronously.

## Overview

Welcome to the Meme Creator app, where you’ll learn to fetch data from the internet to create panda memes.

To create a meme, you’ll load some images from a URL, which could take some time depending on the speed of your internet connection to the server. You’ll use an asynchronous request so that your app can keep doing other things in the background, like responding to user actions, while you’re waiting for the images to load into the UI.

In this walkthrough, you’ll learn how asynchronous data fetching works, and how to use it when retrieving panda images and their corresponding data in JSON format.
