# Seismometer

Present dynamic data in custom views.

## Overview

Welcome to Seismometer.

You can use your iPad to detect vibrations using its built-in motion sensors. This sample shows how to display vibration information in two formats: a needle and a line graph.

Try out Seismometer by placing your iPad on a flat surface and then jostling it a bit. Or you can hold your iPad and move it up and down slowly.
