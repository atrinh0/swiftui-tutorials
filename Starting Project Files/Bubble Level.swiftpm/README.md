## Overview

Welcome to Bubble Level.

A bubble level helps you determine whether something is level or tilted.

This app displays the orientation of your device as numbers and as a graphical version of a bubble level. Try tilting your device and watch the bubble move. Try to make your device level by centering the bubble in the crosshairs. Or place it on a surface like your bedroom floor to determine whether the floor is level.
